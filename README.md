# Cookiecutter_Angular10

## What does this project do

1. It has integration of bootstrap and primeng within it. No need to seperatly add the dependencies and worry about configuration.
2. Folder structure is catogorised as "Core" , "Modules" and "shared" .

   Core for standerd services and major components like Authentication, constants, Card component, Slider component etc.
   
   Modules for main pages or views like "Home", "Search" etc.
   
   Shared for components,filters that are used in mulltiple components like "dropdown" , "customized multiselect" etc  
3. Authentication mechanism with ( OKTA Open ID and AWS Cognito ) ready to use with route guard created and AWS APIG Client rest api integrated in api.service for making Rest calls with AWS.

4. A single "env.js" file for storing sensitive information integrated with "Env Service" and values of env.js file can be accessed with service "EnvservService" injection in components. This give more flexibility, security and reusability.

5. Modules are lazy loaded to avoide unnecessary dependency injections.

## How to use
1. Install cookiecutter with "pip install --user cookiecutter"

2. After installation is complete run following command " cookiecutter https://github.com/parupati/Cookiecutter_Angular10 "

3. It will prompt you to enter project name and other necessary details. click enter it will create the boiler plate for your angular application.

4. Navigate to project folder with cd <project name>, then install dependencies with npm install.
  
5. Final step is to run your project with ng serve. Then the project starts running on localhost:4200.

6. Navigate to "<project name>/src/env.js". Fill the respective values of OKTA and AWS Cognito. These values can be accessed by dependency injecting "EnvservService". In this way you can maintain env.js file as a private file and secure sensitive information. even "env.js" can be configured according to environment without effecting any part of the code.
  
7. Navigate to "<project Name>/src/app/core/services/auth.service.ts" and uncomment line no 19( let access = await this.authenticate(); ) by removing next line which is ( let access = true; ). Authenticate() function will return true or false, before uncommenting Authenticate() you need to make sure to enter proper data in env.js file.

8. Now your application with OKTA Open Id authentication mechanism is ready and you can start building components using primeng and Bootstrap.
